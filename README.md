### Data Source

The primary dataset is the employee data compiled in the "DeckHT Attrition Project.xslx" file.

### Tools

- Excel: Data analysis, Visualization, and Reporting
- Power Query: Data Cleaning

### Data Cleaning

In this phase, I did the following:
1. Data loading and inspection in Power Query
2. Remove unwanted columns
3. Remove unwanted rows
4. Split columns
5. Replace headers
6. Trim
7. Correct data types


### Data Transformation

In this phase, I did the following:
1. Create Data Ranges
2. Conditional Statements
3. Replace Values


### Exploratory Data Analysis

This involved initial modelling like: 
- Employee Composition
- Attrition
- Attrition Rate
- Gender composition
- Gender Attrition
- Gender Attrition Rate


### Data Analysis


- Pivot Tables
- KPI Indicators
- Visualization


### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. **Gender and Attrition**
   - The workforce is predominantly male. However, females show a higher attrition rate of 34% compared to 27% among males. This suggests underlying gender-specific challenges affecting job satisfaction or engagement levels among female employees.

2. **Pay and Satisfaction Disparities**
   - Male employees earn an average of $4,000 more than female employees, with an average company salary of $62,000.

3. **Age Group Dynamics**
   - Attrition is most prominent in employees aged 31-35 and 26-30, with rates of 38.9% and 27.8%, respectively. These age groups represent nearly two-thirds of all employees leaving DeckHT.

4. **Departmental Differences**
   - Attrition is spread across departments, with HR, Finance, Sales, and Marketing showing relatively high turnover.
   - However, IT and Engineering, at 7.7% and 6.8% respectively, have the lowest attrition.

5. **Job Role Vulnerabilities**
   - Among job roles, Specialists have the highest attrition rate at 41%, followed by Analysts at 35%.
   - Accountants have the lowest attrition at 12% but experience below-average job satisfaction.  

6. **Job Satisfaction Insights**
   - A concerning 57% of departing employees rate job satisfaction as poor or below average.
   - 50% of current employees rate satisfaction as average and 29% as dissatisfied.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, to reduce attrition, we recommend the following actions:

1. **Enhance Female Engagement**
   - Conduct focus groups or surveys with female employees to understand their specific challenges, such as work-life balance, career advancement opportunities, and workplace culture to implement changes that foster a more supportive environment for women at DeckHT.
   - Consider policies like flexible work hours or remote work options, which may appeal more to female employees and improve retention.

2. **Close the Pay Gap and Improve Pay Transparency**
   - Review and adjust compensation policies to close the $4,000 pay gap between male and female employees, ensuring pay equity across the organization.
   - Increase transparency around salary ranges and criteria for raises and promotions, so employees have a clear understanding of how to progress financially within the company.

3. **Focus on Key Age Groups**
   - Create targeted professional development opportunities for employees in the 26-35 age range, such as leadership training, career path planning, and skill-building workshops.
   - Consider offering retention bonuses or loyalty incentives for employees who stay past the 5-year mark, particularly for those in this age group.

4. **Support Specialist and Analyst Roles**
   - Provide additional training, support, and clear advancement opportunities for Specialists and Analysts to improve their job satisfaction and engagement.
   - Review workload distribution for these roles and consider adjusting KPIs or targets to avoid burnout, a common cause of high turnover in specialized positions.
   - Recognize and reward achievements in these roles more frequently to show appreciation for their contributions.

5. **Review Sales Role Structure**
   - Sales roles show poor performance ratings and low job satisfaction despite a low attrition rate. Addressing KPIs and providing support to enhance their effectiveness could improve their engagement and job satisfaction, potentially preventing future turnover.

6. **Enhance Support for Accountants**
   - Offer additional support for Accountants who report low job satisfaction despite having the lowest attrition rate.
   - Consider providing incentives like professional development funds, job enrichment, or flexible work options to enhance their overall work experience.
   - Solicit regular feedback from Accountants to address any ongoing concerns before they escalate.

7. **Enhance Support and Retention Efforts in High-Turnover Departments**
   - Engage with employees in HR, Finance, Sales, and Marketing to identify department-specific issues contributing to high turnover.
   - Explore department-level retention strategies, such as revisiting workloads, increasing team-building activities, and ensuring that employees have growth opportunities within their departments.
   - Consider implementing cross-departmental mentorship programs where stable departments like IT and Engineering can share best practices to foster job satisfaction.


8. **Improve Job Satisfaction Across the Board**
   - Launch an employee satisfaction survey to gather feedback on what employees value most in their roles and what changes they would like to see.
   - Develop a recognition program that rewards both individual and team achievements, fostering a culture of appreciation and engagement.
   - Improve career progression clarity across all job roles, so employees understand their growth paths and feel motivated to stay with DeckHT long-term.


### Conclusion

The analysis of DeckHTâ€™s attrition data provides a clear path forward. By addressing issues specific to demographics, roles, and satisfaction levels, DeckHT can create a more engaging and supportive environment that reduces turnover and strengthens its workforce. Taking immediate, targeted action will not only help retain existing talent but also foster a culture of growth and satisfaction for future employees.
